-> Class is the basic block of Java program.
-> To use most classes, we have to create objects.
-> An object is a runtime instance of a class in memory.

-> Class : Fields(variables) and Methods.
		Fields - Holds the state of the program.
		Methods - Operate onn the state.

-> Keyword : word with special meaning.

## Classes vs. Files

-> A file when having 1 class need not be marked public.
-> A file can have more than one class. In this case, at most one class shall be public and the file should be named by it. Otherwise compile error occur.
-> Period has a reserved meaning in JVM **** What is it??
-> Keyword static binds a method to its class so it can be called just by the class name. Like, Zoo.main()
-> import java.util.*; == This does not import child packages, fields or methods. It only imports all the classes in this package java.util

-> Using import java.util.*; does not slow down the program. Compiler will figure out what is actually needed. 

-> java.lang is imported by default. No need to import it explicitly. It would be redundant.
-> Refer ImportExample program.
